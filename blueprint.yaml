  The keyword spotting tutorial detects keywords spoken into a microphone, using Edge Impulse's machine learning capabilities. 
  
  This app is designed to be deployed on Particle devices, such as the Photon 2, Boron, and M-SoM, and uses sensors to monitor and classify water flow patterns. It is pre-programmed to detect "Yes" and "No" but you can train the model using Edge Impulse for any keywords.

  Key Features:
  - Utilizes Edge Impulse's machine learning platform to train a model for identifying spoken keywords
  - Compatible with Particle devices, allowing seamless deployment and edge processing.
